<p>The package providing the API allowing you to construct your own
    Codecs, <em>and</em> to extend the way Codecs are constructed.</p>

<p>If all you want to do is basically use the default way Codecs
    are getting constructed, then the best place to start is the {@link
    org.codehaus.preon.Codecs} class. This class carries everything
    required to construct new Codecs, to use Codecs and to document
    Codecs.</p>
