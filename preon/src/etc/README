README

  1.0-SNAPSHOT

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Preon aims to provide a framework for dealing with binary encoded data; or
   more specifically, it aims to deal with situations in which bytes are
   considered to be overkill. The project is named after the "point-like"
   particles, conceived to be subcomponents of quarks and leptons. Let's just
   say very small particles that you don't see with the naked eye, but you
   probably rely on them without knowing.

Current Status

   Preon is not released yet. There are a couple of known issues that will
   have to be resolved, and some interface choices that need to be clarified.
   Version 1.0 of Preon is expected to be released in Q1 2009.

Limitations

   Not listed here, until version 1.0 is released.

Contents

   The binary distribution of Preon includes two Preon libraries in lib.

   preon-bitbuffer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

           The library providing a ByteBuffer-alike abstraction for accessing
           potentially non-byte-aligned sequences of bits, and a number of
           implementations.

   preon-binding-1.0-SNAPSHOT

           The library providing the classes, interfaces and annotations for
           binding a Java-based data structure to a binary encoded
           representation.

   The directory lib/ext includes additional libraries that may be required
   to use Preon, depending on your needs.

   The directory doc includes a number of PDF documents that will hopefully
   some grow into a full manual. It also includes the Javadoc documentation
   of all Preon classes and interfaces.

License

Distribution

   The full distribution of Preon can be downloaded from
   [1]http://sourceforge.net/projects/preon/. However, it may be easier to
   point Maven to the snapshot repository, at
   [2]http://preon.sourceforge.net/snapshots/. You are allowed to distribute
   Preon through a Maven repository.
