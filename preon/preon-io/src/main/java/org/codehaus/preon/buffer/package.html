<p>
    The package providing the abstractions for dealing with data
    encoded in sequences of bits. The main abstraction to understand
    is {@link nl.flotsam.preon.buffer.BitBuffer BitBuffer}; it
    is similar to the <code>ByteBuffer</code> interface found in
    Java NIO, only in this case it acts on the bit level, as opposed
    to byte level.
</p>

<p>
    Another important abstraction is {@link
    nl.flotsam.preon.buffer.DefaultBitBuffer
    DefaultBitBuffer}. This implementation wraps a ByteBuffer,
    providing the storage for the bytes accessed through the
    <code>BitBuffer</code> interface.
